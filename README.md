# QAPG
QAPG is a QA software testing technique, which can generate general test inputs and achieve precise testing. This repo is the artifact for my master's thesis.


### Run QAPG

run QAPG to generate all new test cases and detected bugs. 
The results are saved in path `QAPG/results/`

```
cd script/
python run.py project_name  # valid project_name are 'boolq', 'squad2', 'narrative' 
```
